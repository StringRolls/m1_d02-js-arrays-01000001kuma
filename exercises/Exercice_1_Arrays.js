//1. Using `push` and `unshift`, make this array contain the numbers from zero through seven:


let arr = [2, 3, 4];
let arr1 = "";
(arr.unshift(0,1) + arr.push(5,6,7));

// your code here

console.log(arr); // => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]


//2. What is _returned_ by `push`? Before throwing this into the console, form a hypothesis about what you think the return value will be:


let arrOf = [5, 7, 9];
arrOf.push(6); // returns [5,7,9,6]


//3. Change all numbers to be those numbers multiplied by two:


let numbers = [4, 9, 7, 2, 1, 8];

// your code here

numbers; // => [8, 18, 14, 4, 2, 16]


//4. Change all **odd** numbers to be those numbers multiplied by two:



numbers = [4, 9, 7, 2, 1, 8];

// your code here

numbers; // => [4, 18, 14, 2, 2, 8]
